<p style="color: navy;"><b>Computer software:</b> Refers to a collection of programs, data, and instructions that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks. It can be categorized into two main types:</p>

<p><b>1. System Software:</b> This software is responsible for managing and controlling the hardware components of a computer. It includes operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux, which provide a platform for other software to run. System software also includes device drivers that enable communication between the hardware and the operating system.</p>

<p><b>2. Application Software:</b> Application software is designed to perform specific tasks or applications for the user. This category includes a wide range of programs, such as word processors, web browsers, spreadsheet applications, graphic design tools, and video games. Application software allows users to interact with and make use of the computer's capabilities.</p>

<p style="color: navy;"><b>Here are some key points about computer software:</b></p>
<ul>
 <li>Software is written in programming languages, such as C++, Java, Python, and many others.</li>
 <li>It can be installed on a computer's storage devices, like hard drives or solid-state drives.</li>
 <li>Software can be proprietary (commercial) or open-source (freely available with its source code).</li>
 <li>Updates and patches are often released to improve software functionality and security.</li>
 <li>Software can be classified further into categories like productivity, entertainment, communication, and more.</li>
 <li>The user interacts with software through a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI).</li>
</ul>

<p>Computer software is essential for the functioning of modern computing devices, enabling users to perform a wide range of tasks, from basic word processing to complex data analysis and simulations.</p>
